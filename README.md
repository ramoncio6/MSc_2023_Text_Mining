# MSc_2023_Text_Mining
Final Text Mining Project (BSE 2023) with David Vallmanya and Irene Villalonga. \

Abstract: \

The initial stage of our research involves accessing the Reddit API to extract all responses -including
metadata- from the post "Donald Trump has not made a single lasting positive impact on the USA during
his term as president". Subsequently, we undertake pre-processing activities such as handling missing
values, stop word removal, tokenization, and lemmatization to construct the Document Term matrix. We
then identify emotion analysis as a more suitable technique for forecasting document scores than sentiment
and perform a descriptive analysis that relates emotion prevalence to document scores. Finally, we train
a baseline model using top terms and compare it to our definitive model, which assesses the predictive
power emotions have on document score or popularity.
