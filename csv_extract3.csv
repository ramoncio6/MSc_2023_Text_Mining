> “We heard arguments from both sides on the constitutionality of having a Senate trial of a president who has since left office. A sufficient amount of evidence of constitutionality exists for the Senate to proceed with the trial. This vote is not a prejudgment on the final vote to convict,” said Dr. Cassidy. “If anyone disagrees with my vote and would like an explanation, I ask them to listen to the arguments presented by the House Managers and former President Trump’s lawyers.

Bill Cassidy

And the way he spoke to reporters afterwards, he was so clear lol. I loved it. It was the opposite of Castor the friendly ~~ghost~~ lawyer's arguments.

Edit:

>Sen. Bill Cassidy: “If anyone disagrees with my vote and would like an explanation I ask them to listen to the arguments presented by the House Managers and former Pres. Trump’s lawyers. The House managers had much stronger constitutional arguments. The president’s team did not.”

Why is the emphasis for Republicans strictly on the rhetoric and the interpretation of Trump's speech on January 6th?

***This isn't just about one speech.***

It's about four years of hateful, divisive rhetoric, fearmongering propaganda, lies, misinformation and conspiracies from Donald J Trump At his rallies, speeches, press conferences, interviews on FOX news and on Twitter. But more importantly it's about the months leading up to the 2020 general election and the months that followed where Trump perpetuated a baseless lie and conspiracy theory surrounding a ""rigged"" election that convinced nearly every single one of his supporters that the election was stolen from ***them.*** Take these things out of the equation and you have no storming of the capitol. Those mindless halfwits were there for Trump, they brandished their flags for Trump, they carried their banners for Trump, they broke into the capitol for Trump. They Rallied for him and chanted ""Hang Mike Pence"" for him. They erected a gallows for him. They beat police with an American flag for him. They were going to kill for him. They all did it for him and directly because of his actions and rhetoric. PERIOD.

Remember Jim Jones? Remember when 900 people committed mass suicide via cyanide laced punch? Do you think those poor people would have done so if they had listened to Jim Jones for the first time that day? Heard just one speech? FUCK NO, it took countless speeches, endless proselytizing and preaching, and many many lies. It wasn't just one speech that created the circumstances for the storming of the capitol, it was months, nay YEARS of speeches, rallies, and twitter rants that fueled a movement of hate and vitriol, division, fearmongering, bigotry, misinformation and conspiracies.";0;37;0;2021-02-10 00:33:23;37

So they voted after Rand Paul forced the vote last week. 

So we spend the first hours of the trial today on this 'question', and the Trump legal team cannot formulate an argument questioning the constitutionality of the impeachment. 

Turley may have told them what they wanted to hear last week, but it is the exact opposite of what he very definitively argues in his own words from his work in 1999.  The Trump legal team would have run right into paragraphs of quotes advocating for a post-resignation Nixon impeachment trial from their boy Turley and how good it would have been to our democratic systems, and a way of healing the country and moving forward .

Republican Senators set this 'question' up for debate, and voted on it, despite not having an actual advocate for their position present their side of the 'question'.

And that's all it took for 44 Republican Senators to vote declaring impeachment unconstitutional.

SCOTUS in a unanimous decision held that the court could not review the impeachment and trial of a federal officer because the Const. solely reserved that process to the Senate.

While 3 justices concurred and wrote opinions basically saying that SCOTUS was prematurely closing the door on reviewing impeachment and thr door should be left open in case things came down to a fine hair in the impeachment trial those were not majority opinions.

And given that justices can be impeached and removed as well I highly doubt a court after 1993 is going to find themselves meddling with that issue.
